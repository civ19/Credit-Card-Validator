# Credit-Card-Validator

## This is a Credit Card Validator, with Luhn's Algorithm as the logic. 
A simple CLI-ran project to test if your credit card number is valid or not. 

## Instructions on how to use
To use the executable without it breaking or outputting error messages, there are a few things you have to make sure of:
- When the program asks you to input your card number, it **must** be 16 digits. If you do more or less than that, then it will print `Credit card is invalid. Not 16 digits`.
- All you have to do is put in a 16 digit card number, and based on that, the system will tell you if its valid or not.
- After you get your result, you may exit the executable by pressing enter.
